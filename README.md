# NewtonFractal

**NewtonFractal** is a *Qt5-Application* that renders fractals based on **Newton's method**.

- Move up to *6* roots with drag & drop
- Move fractal
- Zoom in and out
- Export fractal as *png*
- Multi- or singlethreading
- Change maximum number of newton iterations, ...

## Getting Started

Get started by either downloading the current release (for *Windows*) or by building it with `qmake` and `make` (for *Windows*, *Linux* and *Mac*).

### Prerequisites

To build this application, you will need Qt5. If you are going to build on Windows, you need to make sure, that your `PATH` variable contains paths to *Qt* and *MinGW* / *MSVC* toolsets (*bin* folder).

### Building

Clone the GitHub repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrizbee/NewtonFractal NewtonFractal
cd NewtonFractal
```

Build it using `qmake` and `make`
```bash
qmake
make [release | debug]
```
*Note*: The `release` build will be much faster than `debug`.

Run the application
```bash
cd build
./NewtonFractal
```
